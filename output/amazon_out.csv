Would you like to tell us about a lower price?","    I have tried many, many foundations over the years - from high end to drug store brands, and this is hands down the best I have ever used. I always find myself coming back to this one. I have been wearing it paired with their Mineral Sheers Powder Foundation for years and the coverage is always perfect. Never too cakey, lasts all day. I am often complimented on my makeup and asked what type I use and people are always surprised when I tell them Neutrogena instead of some fancy overpriced brand name. 100% recommend.            I love this foundation. Really good for my sensitive skin that gets irritated from almost anything. I've been using this for over 2 years now.            I work 12 hour shifts at a theme park - I am outside the entire time. Of course, I searched Sephora for the longest-wearing foundation and forked out good money for several including Estee Lauder's Double Wear, but I wasn't impressed. Cue more research that led me to Neutrogena. As someone who works in the cold, blazing heat, humidity, sun, and/or rain for 12 hours at a time let me tell you this is the best foundation I have ever used. I honestly don't even need powder (despite sweating!), the SPF is an excellent bonus, and by the end of the day I don't resemble a melted wax figure. 10/10            Honestly was not expecting much from this with its great price and all, but it goes on smooth and blends perfectly. I can usually see my foundation on my skin especially where my skin is dry, but not this one. Color matches great too. New favorite :)            I had ordered this exact product once before and didn't think it would be any good due to the price being so cheap, but guess what; I was wrong!  You don't need so much to spread and even through sweat; it does not run!!!  It actually looks so natural on me and I received many compliments about my makeup with the help of this product.  I will be ordering again.  Bye bye Shishiedo :)    "

Would you like to tell us about a lower price?","    I know it says right on the bottle that this product is FRAGRANCE FREE which is why I am so angry about this body wash.  There is no need to lie about it.  I can find other fragrance free soaps, they are harder to find, but it isn't impossible.  Why Aveeno?!Right when I popped open the lid I could smell the myrrha.  I bought some years ago from a Middle eastern grocery store, it came in a small bag, it is weird looking little dried rock things.  It sorta reminds me of the dried yellow sap you might find on a pine tree.  Which is pretty much what commiphora myrrha oil is, its the dried compound of a tree that is native to the Arabian Peninsula.  It is sometimes used in medicines, but its main use is in perfumes.Anyways, this bottle is a total waste for me and my family.  I might try to send it back, there is no way I could risk using it, even though the myrrha is listed as one of the last ingredients.  If I can't return it I will give it to a friend who doesn't have my skin problems.Aveeno, you can do better by your loyal customers.            For the past 9 years I have had intermittent itchy skin that is not season dependent and unrelieved with scratching. It has gotten so bad, I have left scars on my legs from scratching so much. I have tried dozens of lotions and body washes including Cetaphil, Dove, Eucerin, Vaseline, CeraVe, Nivea, Suave, and other Aveeno products. Nothing has consistently kept the itching away until I found the combination of Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Body Wash and Moisturizing Lotion. With daily to every other day use, my legs have improved tremendously. I have chosen many products with no fragrance and oatmeal, but something about this combination has been a lifesaver. I will continue to be repurchasing these again and again.            Another eczema sufferer here, this is the only lotion ive used for approximately 7 years because its the only one I've found that 1. doesnt ever burn no matter how destroyed my skin is 2. actually keeps moisturizing throughout the day and 3. even soothes my skin slightly. I used to get INSANELY itchy after showers, but this stuff combined with using natural goat milk soap completely stopped that. It has a nice soft oatmeal smell and really works. Its not a miracle cure or anything but is definitely the solid foundation of my eczema care routine.            We stopped using personal care products with artificial fragrance a few years back and it can be hard to find good options since most products contain ""fragrance"" or ""parfum"" in the list of ingredients. This is just a generic phrase that manufacturers can use as a stand-in for the actual chemical compounds that they use to generate a scent.  I guess it's to allow them to maintain their trade secrets or something. Anyway, once you stop using products with artificial fragrance, you start to really notice and hate the smell of any artificial fragrance.Keep in mind that this product does still have a scent, it isn't completely neutral, but it's a very mild and much more natural scent. Also, despite the packaging and marketing, this is not by any means an organic or fully natural product. There are other chemical compounds in it that you would find in most similar products on the market. For us, the fragrance is the big thing that we try to avoid.So this is a great product for us because I have sensitive skin and this doesn't dry me out. It washes clean very nicely too. A lot of other products will cause me to break out sometimes, but this has been my go-to body wash for years now and I would highly recommend it.            Started using this a year ago when my husband was diagnosed with psoriasis.  He battled really dry skin before switching to Aveeno Active Naturals.  His psoriasis was starting to get really bad.  After switching to the fragrance free Aveeno his skin started to heal.  I know that this product does not make any claims to heal psoriasis but it definitely has helped his skin in our particular case.  He is not on any meds or creams and has not had any skin issues since last year.  My skin has also been so soft and moisturized.  With all of the chemicals in everything that we are using, it helps to go fragrance free for a body wash.  If this review has helped you in any way please let me know.  Thanks!    "

Would you like to tell us about a lower price?","    I use Aveeno face scrub and spectrum moisturizer I usually buy it from target as an kit for $16.99 total because individually it can be pricey. I saw a 3 item kit on amazon for scrub, body wash, and lotion for $9.99 I thought it was an amazing deal. I’m happy with my purchase, but I wish the face scrub could of been a bigger bottle like the other 2 items. But still $9.99 you can’t beat this price. I like Aveeno it helps brighten my skin from acne scars and my PCOS condition dark areas on my neck and chin. The body wash helps as well for those with body acne on the shoulders or scars and lotion is a bonus for dry skin or skin cleaning routine.            I bought this as a random little present for my mom and I. We both enjoy the lotion in here. It is lightweight and moisturizing, good quality. As an added bonus we get body wash to try and the small bottle of face wash. I will update this review after trying both of those. The lotion however is awesome.            I have allergies and this smells very nice and really does moisturize your skin.            The body wash and lotion are full size. The daily facial scrub however is just 2 oz. like trial size. 🤷 Why? I would have rather have had them all about the same size, rather than a dinky one and two ginormous ones.            Love this set! Perfectly gentle for daily use    "

Would you like to tell us about a lower price?","    I've used this since i was 18. I am now 26. Im not a HUGE make up fan, but i've always used this. Gives me just enough coverage to look like i have perfectly matte skin without looking like i'm wearing makeup.  i believe that skin care is more important than any make up you put on and i love that this has never given me any breakouts or made my face feel itchy. Great if you have sensitive skin, like me!            This is my favorite powder - if you really like the matte look and are worried about makeup clogging your pores and causing acne, this is the powder for you. It's not super noticeable if you don't want it to be - it can give a really nice, natural matte finish. It can be a little drying, but I use it with a liquid foundation so it balances out perfectly. It lasts pretty long and seems to really control shine, and it never feels heavy or overdone.            Great mineral base. Gentle on my skin but effective against oil.            My dermatologist recommended this since it non-hypogenic.  I would totally recommend because it is light and not cakey.  It matches my skin color perfectly and makes my skin look smooth.  A lot of people say I have clear skin, however it is just this mineral powder covering my blemishes. :)            Great product. I have been using it for many years.    "
